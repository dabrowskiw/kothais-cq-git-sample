# Basic important Git commands

## 1. git add

Description: Adds changes in your working directory to the staging area, preparing them to be committed. This command doesn’t save changes permanently but marks them for the next commit.

## 2. git commit

Description: Records the changes in the staging area to the repository’s history with a descriptive message. Each commit acts as a snapshot of your project at a particular time.

## 3. git status

Description: The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which files have been modified, which files are staged for the next commit, and which files are untracked by Git.

## 4. git push
